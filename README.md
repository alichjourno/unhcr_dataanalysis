# Analysis of UNHCR Data

A Python project as an exercise in the course "Data Journalism with Python" by Natalie Widmann.

## Project Description

For the exercise, the API of the UNHCR was used, and data about refugees was cleaned, processed, and visualized. All data was translated from English to German in the process. In addition, the data was journalistically classified with the help of texts.

## Target

Words like "refugee crisis" fuel the debate about how to deal with refugees. The debate is charged and polarized in the media as well as in everyday life. In order to have a sober debate, precise figures from the UNHCR should help and give an overview of how the situation in Germany really is right now.
